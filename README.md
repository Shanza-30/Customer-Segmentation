# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using the Mall Customers dataset. The goal is to group customers based on their age and spending behavior using the K-Means clustering algorithm to support data-driven marketing strategies.


## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and scale customer data
- Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
- Apply K-Means clustering
- Visualize customer segments
- Profile each cluster and suggest marketing actions
- 

## 📂 Dataset
**Source:** Kaggle – Mall Customers Dataset  
**Features Used:**
- Age
- Spending Score (1–100)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Select relevant features  
3. Apply feature scaling using StandardScaler  
4. Use the Elbow Method to choose optimal K  
5. Perform K-Means clustering  
6. Visualize clusters  
7. Analyze cluster profiles  
8. Save cluster labels to CSV
9. 

## 📊 Results
Customers were successfully segmented into distinct groups based on age and spending score, enabling targeted marketing strategies for each segment.


## 💡 Business Insights
- Identified high-value customers for premium offers
- Recognized low-spending groups for discount-based strategies
- Enabled personalized marketing campaigns


## 💾 Output
The final dataset with cluster labels is saved as:
`Customer_Segmentation_With_Clusters.csv`


## 🏷️ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how unsupervised learning can be used to understand customer behavior and improve marketing decision-making.
